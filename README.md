# Fingerprint-Recognition

This project focuses on fingerprint recognition using the SOCOFing dataset. The goal is to determine whether a fingerprint is real or altered using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. Google Colab is used. Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ruizgara/socofing

In this project, the dataset is treated as if it has only two subfolders: Real and Altered. The images from all three altered subfolders (Altered-Easy, Altered-Medium, and Altered-Hard) are combined into a single Altered folder.
